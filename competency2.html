        In summer 2025 I attended the <b> Certification in College Teaching Institute (CCTI) </b> which completed the workshop requirement for this certification.
        CCTI is a professional development seminar series aimed at helping students completing the certification in college teaching process. 
        During this workshop, I attended a presentation on "Creating Effective Learning Environments" by Dr. Kristin Parkin.    
        In this presentation, Dr. Parkin discussed the importance of creating inclusive and equitable learning environments and focused on understanding student diversity and fostering a sense of belonging among students.
        Dr. Parkin highlights the importance connecting with our students and provides strategies for achieving this goal. 
        I appreciated Dr. Parkin's emphasis on understanding the diversity of backgrounds and experiences that students bring to the classroom. 
        As an educator, I believe it is important to recognize and value these differences and create a space where all students feel included and respected.
        Additionally, this presentation challenged some of my own notions on equitable classrooms and equitable grading practices.
        It has led me to reevaluate how I think about equitably assessing student learning.

<h2 class="text-left"> Reflection on Creating Effective Learning Environments </h2>

    <p>
        I believe that as educators, we should aim to create classrooms where students feel safe and supported so that they can take intellectual risks. 
        Learning is a messy process and students need to feel comfortable making mistakes and grappling with difficult concepts to grow.
        Building a community within the classroom can hopefully give students the space to take risks and engage deeply with the material.
        Being intentional about creating an inclusive and equitable learning environment is essential can can give students a sense of belonging.  
        When students feel valued and respected, they are more likely to participate actively in class and take ownership of their learning.
