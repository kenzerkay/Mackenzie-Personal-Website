    <h2> Circumgalactic Medium (CGM)</h2>
    <p>
      My graduate research focuses on the distribution of ions in the CGM. 
      I currently use <a href="https://yt-project.org/">yt</a> to unpack <a href="https://enzo-project.org/">ENZO</a> based simulations. 
      These sets of simulations have been tailored by the <a href="https://foggie.science/">FOGGIE</a> collaboration to finely resolve the circumgalactic medium in Milky Way like galaxies. 
      I have been studying the kinematics and distribution of hot and cold gas to uncover how these different phases interact and my current investigations use OVI and MgII as tracers for this hot and cold gas.

    <h2> Stellar Intensity Interferometry (SII)</h2>
    <p>
      My undergraduate work of nearly 3 years focused on the implementation of intensity interferometry on the VERITAS telescopes.
      I worked on developing a novel analysis pipeline which would allow us to measure squared visibilities and obtain angular diameters of approximately spherical sources.  
      This work spawned my first <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...966...28A">publication</a> of which I am corresponding author where I perform an angular diameter measurement of bet UMa assuming spherical symmetry of the star.
