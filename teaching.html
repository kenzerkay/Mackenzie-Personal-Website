    <p> 
        I am currently working towards completing the <a href="https://grad.msu.edu/cctp"> Certification in College Teaching </a> at Michigan State University. 
        This program focuses on completing 5 core competencies and a teaching philosophy statement to show development of key teaching principles.

    <h2 class="text-left">Math and Statistics Learning Center</h2>
    <p> 
        For nearly two and a half years I was a student tutor at the <a href="https://mslc.osu.edu/"> Mathematics and Statistics Learning Center</a> at Ohio State University.  
        I worked both as a one-on-one scheduled appointment tutor and in the drop-in tutoring rooms where students could stop in anytime and ask questions.  
        I helped students in many courses ranging from college algebra, calculus, and linear algebra and I specialized in helping students with multi-variable calculus.
