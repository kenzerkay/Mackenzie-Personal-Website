<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> 
    Hi!
    I'm Mackenzie Ticoras, a third year dual-PhD student in Astrophysics and Computational Math, Science, and Engineering at Michigan State University and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow.
    My research focuses on the multiphase, ionized structure of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), where I use high-resolution simulations from the <a href="https://foggie.science/">FOGGIE</a> collaboration to investigate the distribution of hot and cold gas in the CGM. 
    Outside of research, I am passionate about science communication, mentorship, and creating effective and equitable classrooms.
