    <h3 class="text-left"> Description of Competency </h3>
        <p>
            Competency 1 focuses on developing discipline specific pedagogical strategies and usually some type of formal course is taken to fulfill this requirement  
            To complete this competency, I took  <b> ISE 870: Teaching College Science </b> in Spring 2025. 
            This course focused on scientifically motivated pedagogy for teaching science coursed in particular.

    <h3 class="text-left"> Artifacts from Course </h3>
        <p>
            The artifact I have decided to highlight from this class is the presentation portion of our final project which was given in class during one our of ISE 870 sessions. 
            A significant portion of our final for the course was creating a mock syllabus for a course. 
            We worked in pairs to complete this and my partner and I designed an introductory level course for first years in the astronomy major. 
            In addition to creating the syllabus, we had to design a specific lesson from the course using backwards course design. 
            My partner and I did this for the "what is light?" portion of the course where we propose students completing a spectroscopy lab during class. 
            We had to lay out specifics for what the lesson would look like and how students would be assessed on this topic. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, this class was extremely beneficial in having me reflect on different pedagogical strategies

    <p>
        For Competency 4 I have included an instructions for an activity form this particular professional seminar. 
        The activity was to take everyday items and discuss how we might incorporate them into a lecture in a disciple. 
        My group obtained a rubber band and discussed how we could use this potentially discuss tension forces...............
        I think the really important revelation that I had during this activity is to expand my definition of "technology in the classroom".
        Using the rubber bands as "technology" inspired me to try to be more creative with how objects can be used for educational purposes.
