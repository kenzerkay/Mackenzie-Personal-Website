    <h3 class="text-left"> Description of Competency </h3>
        <p>
            Competency 1 focuses on developing discipline specific pedagogical strategies and usually some type of formal course is taken to fulfill this requirement  
            To complete this competency, I took  <b> ISE 870: Teaching College Science </b> in Spring 2025. 
            This course focused on scientifically motivated pedagogy for teaching science coursed in particular.

    <h3 class="text-left"> Artifacts from Course </h3>
        <p>
            The artifact I have decided to highlight from this class is the presentation portion of our final project which was given in class during one our of ISE 870 sessions. 
            A significant portion of our final for the course was creating a mock syllabus for a course. 
            We worked in pairs to complete this and my partner and I designed an introductory level course for first years in the astronomy major. 
            In addition to creating the syllabus, we had to design a specific lesson from the course using backwards course design. 
            My partner and I did this for the "what is light?" portion of the course where we propose students completing a spectroscopy lab during class. 
            We had to lay out specifics for what the lesson would look like and how students would be assessed on this topic.
