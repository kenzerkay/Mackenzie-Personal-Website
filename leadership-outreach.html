<p style="font-size:18px;"> 

I was a very active member of the computer science club <a href="https://c4cosu.com/">Code 4 Community</a> at Ohio State Univeristy, serving first as treasurer and then as president of the club, each for one year. 
The main goal of this student organization was to introduce K-12 students to the fundamentals of computer science. 
I helped developed multiple modules and led over a dozen outreach presenations at local schools and after school programs in central Ohio. 
If you are looking for something fun to play, I recommend <a href="https://c4cosu.com/cats-and-mice/">Cats & Mice</a> which is a program I helped develop to teach studnet about variables.
