        <h4 class="text-left">Stellar Mentorship Program</h4>
        <p>
            I am currently a part of the Stellar Mentorship Program at Michigan State and this program forms important mentor/mentee relationships that allow for one-on-one discussion of personal career goals.
            I participate in this program both as a mentor to a upper-level undergraduate and also a mentee to a more senior graduate student. 
            Both partnerships have been very enriching and have allowed me to reflect on my career goals and have allowed me to help others with theirs as well.

        <h4 class="text-left">Math and Statistics Learning Center</h4>
        <p> 
            For nearly two and a half years I was a student tutor at the <a href="https://mslc.osu.edu/"> Mathematics and Statistics Learning Center</a> at Ohio State University.  
            I worked both as a one-on-one scheduled appointemnt tutor and in the drop-in tutoring rooms where students could stop in anytime and ask questions.  
            I helped students in many courses ranging from college pre-calculus to linear algrebra, but I mostly focused on multivariable calculus.

        <h4 class="text-left">Code 4 Community</h4>
        <p> 
        I was a very active member of the computer science club <a href="https://c4cosu.com/">Code 4 Community</a> at Ohio State Univeristy, serving first as treasurer and then as president of the club, each for one year. 
        The main goal of this student organization was to introduce K-12 students to the fundamentals of computer science. 
        I helped developed multiple modules and led over a dozen outreach presenations at local schools and after school programs in central Ohio. 
        If you are looking for something fun to play, I recommend <a href="https://c4cosu.com/cats-and-mice/">Cats & Mice</a> which is a program I helped develop to teach students about variables.
