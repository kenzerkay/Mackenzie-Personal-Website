        <h2 class="text-left"> Description of Competency </h2>
        <p>
            Competency 3 focuses on incorporating technology into your teaching practices. 
            I completed this competency during <b> Certification in College Teaching Institute </b> in the summer of 2025.

            For Competency 3 I have chosen to highlight the presentation "Incorporating Technology in your Teaching" by Dr. Stefanie Baier. 
            In this resource, Dr. Baier discusses the importance of incorporating technology into your teaching practices and provides strategies for achieving this goal.
            It is no secret that technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, and this is especially true in the classroom.
            The presentation covers topics such as using technology to enhance student engagement and understanding, as well as the challenges and pitfalls of using technology in the classroom.
        </p>

        <p> 
            We discussed how it is important to not just use technology for the sake of using technology, but to be intentional about how and why you are incorporating it into your teaching practices.
            Through backwards course design, we should be able to identify specific learning goals and then determine how technology can help us achieve those goals.
            We practiced this by designing a mock lesson that incorporated technology in a meaningful way 
            We also imagined what everyday objects could be used as "technology" in the classroom as modeling challenging topics with physical objects can be a powerful tool for student understanding.

        <p>
            For this competency, I have chosen to highlight the mock lesson plan that demonstrates kinematics and gravitational acceleration through a hands-on activity. 
            In this lesson, students a ball and a stopwatch and measure the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground. 
            They can use this data to calculate the acceleration due to gravity and compare their results to the accepted value.
            Once the students have completed the activity, we include questions for them to reflect on their findings and how their results would change under different circumstances. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the spirit of everyday objects as technology, we can use a ball and a stopwatch as simple "technology" to demonstrate the concept of gravitational acceleration.
            We also include easily accessible digital technology such as the online graphing tool Desmos to help students visualize their data and perform calculations.
            Tools like Desmos can be incredibly useful for helping students understand complex concepts and visualize data in a way that is easy to understand.

    <h2 class="text-left"> Reflection </h2>

        <p>
            When reflecting on the broad category of "technology in the classroom", it is apparent to me that almost anything can be an instructional aid with just a little bit of inspiration and creativity.
            We often think of technology as digital, but this is not exclusively true.
