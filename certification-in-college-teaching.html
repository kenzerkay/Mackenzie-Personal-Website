<h2 class="text-left"> About the Program </h2>

<p>
The <a href="https://grad.msu.edu/cctp">Certification in College Teaching</a> (CCT) is a formal certification program at Michigan State University that gives graduate students and postdocs the opportunity to learn about and develop teaching strategies.
The program requires the completion of 4 components: 

<ol>
    <li> Course Work focused on Discipline-Related Teaching Strategies </li>
    <li> Participation in a Teaching Workshop </li>
    <li> Teaching Philosophy Statement </li>
    <li> Mentored Teaching Project </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Within these 4 components, we focus on developing the 5 core competencies:
    <ol>
        <li> <a href="competency1.html">Developing Discipline-Related Teaching Strategies</a></li>
        <li> <a href="competency2.html">Creating Effective Learning Environments</a></li>
        <li> <a href="competency3.html">Incorporating Technology in your Teaching</a></li>
        <li> <a href="competency4.html">Understanding the University Context</a></li>
        <li> <a href="competency5.html">Assessing Student Learning</a></li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    Within this portfolio, I will be documenting my progress towards completing each of these 5 core competencies, outlining the work I have done to fulfill the requirements of each competency, and reflecting on what I have learned through the process.
    I want to highlight that this is a work in progress, and I am still in the process of completing the requirements for each competency.
    I look forward to continuing to develop my teaching skills and knowledge and will continue to update this portfolio with my experiences as I progress through this program.
