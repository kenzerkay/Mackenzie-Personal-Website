<p>
The <a href="https://grad.msu.edu/cctp">Certification in College Teaching</a> (CCT) is a formal certification program at Michigan State University that gives graduate students and postdocs the opportunity to learn about and develop teaching strategies. 
This program focuses on completing 5 core competencies and a teaching philosophy statement to show development of key teaching principles.
