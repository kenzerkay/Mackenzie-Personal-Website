<h2 class="text-left"> Description of Competency </h2>
<p>
    Competency 1 focuses on exploring pedagogical techniques for teaching in a given field. 
    There are a wide variety of different educational strategies to employ but their effectiveness can vary based on topic and audience. 
    As a computational astrophysics who is interested in higher education it is incredibly important to keep that context in mind when thinking about teaching practices.
    That is why I took <b> ISE 870: Teaching College Science </b> in Spring 2025 which is a course at Michigan State that focuses on the topic and audience I want to gear myself towards. 
    In this semester long-course we examined many different teaching strategies including modeling, argument driven inquiry, and backwards design, and would practice implementing these techniques by creating mock lessons for classes at the college level.

<h2 class="text-left"> Artifact from ISE 870 </h2>
<p> 
    I have included the syllabus for ISE 870 to highlight some of the topics we discussed and activities we completed during this class. 
    The main focus of the course was to allow us to explore different teaching practices and for every teaching practice we learned we had to plan how we could implement that into a real-world classroom setting. 
    Most of the class periods were focused on active collaboration with our peers where we would discuss the pros and cons of each teaching strategy and how we could implement these strategies in our own (sometimes hypothetical) classrooms.
    We tackled the many other discussion topics such as the difficulty in teaching large classes and how to engage students at different levels of knowledge in the subject matter.

<h2 class="text-left"> Material Developed During ISE 870 </h2>
<p>
    A significant portion of the course was spent working on a final project that incorporated many of the teaching strategies we learned throughout the semester.
    We created a mock syllabus for a course and designed a specific lesson using backwards course design.
    My partner and I designed an introductory level course for first years in the astronomy major and used backwards design to create a hands-on lesson for the topic of spectra. 
    I have chosen to highlight the final presentation that my partner and I gave for this project.
    This presentation neatly summarizes our course and the specific lesson we designed.

<h2 class="text-left"> Reflection on Discipline-Related Teaching Strategies </h2>
<p>
    Overall, this class was extremely beneficial in having me reflect on different pedagogical practices. 
    This course gave me the freedom and knowledge to explore teaching techniques and strategize on how to implement them in a real world classroom setting. 
    The content of ISE 870 also incorporated content from many of the other competencies in the certification process, so I found that this course also gave me great preparation for working on the other Certification Topics.

<p>
    Reflecting on the overall idea of "Discipline-Related Teaching Strategies," I recognize the need for flexibility in my teaching approach.
    I have come to appreciate the importance of tailoring my teaching methods to the specific needs and backgrounds of my students and as an educator, I should always be open to feedback and willing to adjust my strategies to better support my students' learning.
    It can be easy to fall into a routine of using the same teaching methods, but continuously exploring and experimenting with new approaches to enhance student engagement and understanding is essential.
    Not every technique will work for every class, so being adaptable and willing to change is key to being an effective educator.
