<h2 class="text-left"> Description of Competency </h2>

    <p>
    Competency 4 focuses on understanding the systems and structures of higher education and leveraging that information to be maximal effective in your role as an academic and educator.
    I completed this competency during the <b> Certification in College Teaching Institute </b> in the summer of 2025.

<h2 class="text-left"> Artifacts and Materials </h2>
    <p>
        During the institute, we analyzed and discussed the mission statements of different types of universities and read excerpts from their teaching handbooks/manuals.
        I knew before the workshop that there were various types of universities; however, this activity illuminated the differences between these institutions and how they impact the teaching practices and expectations for faculty.
        I have included the annotations/notes I took on these mission and teaching statements and discuss some of the surface level differences between these institutions.
        It is crucial to understand these differences because they will impact how I approach my teaching and research in different settings.

<h2 class="text-left"> Reflection on Understanding the University Context </h2>

    <p>
        Reflecting on the idea of "Understanding the University Context," I have come to appreciate the diversity and complexity of higher education institutions.
        Institutions have unique priorities and values, and understanding these differences can help me tailor my teaching and research to meet the needs of my students and colleagues.
        During the CCTI seminar, we not only discusses the different types of institutions, but also the problems that all of higher education is currently facing.
        One of the main issues in the rise in distrust in higher education and the devaluation of a college degree.
        This is a complex issue with many contributing factors, but I believe as educators we need to be aware of this issue and work towards addressing it.
        We can do this by being transparent about the value of higher education and the skills and knowledge that students gain from their college experience.
        We can also work towards making higher education more accessible and affordable for all students.
