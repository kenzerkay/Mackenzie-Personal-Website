<h2 class="text-left"> Description of Competency </h2>

    <p>
    Competency 4 focuses on understanding the systems and structures of higher education and leveraging that information to be maximal effective in your role as an academic and educator.
    I completed this competency during the <b> Certification in College Teaching Institute </b> in the summer of 2025.

<h2 class="text-left"> Artifacts from Course </h2>
    <p>
        During the institute, we analyzed and discussed the mission statements of different types of universities and also read excerpts from their teaching handbooks/manuals.
        I knew before that there were various types of universities, but it was not clear to me before this activity how the different goals of these institutions would impact the teaching practices and expectations for faculty.
        I have included the annotations/notes I took on these mission statements and teaching statements and highlight some of the surface level differences between these institutions.
        It is crucial to understand these differences because they will impact how I approach my teaching and research in different settings.

<h2 class="text-left"> Reflection </h2>

    <p>
        Reflecting on the idea of "Understanding the University Context," I realize the importance of being adaptable and flexible in my approach to teaching and research.
        Different institutions have different priorities and values, and it is essential to understand these differences to be an effective educator and researcher.
        I have learned that being open to new ideas and approaches is crucial in navigating the complexities of higher education.
        By understanding the context in which I am working, I can better tailor my teaching and research to meet the needs of my students and colleagues.

    <p>  
        During the CCTI seminar, we not only discusses the different types of institutions, but also the problems that all of higher education is currently facing.
        One of the main issues in the rise in distrust in higher education and the devaluation of a college degree.
        This is a complex issue with many contributing factors, but I believe it is our goal as educators to be aware of this issue and work towards addressing it.
        We can do this by being transparent about the value of higher education and the skills and knowledge that students gain from their college experience.
        We can also work towards making higher education more accessible and affordable for all students.
